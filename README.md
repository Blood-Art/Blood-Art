<h3> Hello. 👋 </h3>

I am @Blood (**Fahad**), or you can call me whatever you like. 

MIS major university student, mostly self-taught and obsessed with Tech and Programming 💻.

My goals are:
- 🐍 Mastering **Python** with its extensive libraries (Very interested and actively learning about AI/Machine Learning).
- ⚡ Learning some **C++** or **Rust** for their incredible performance.
- 🤝 Collaborating and gaining expertise with other developers by making interesting projects.

I am aware of the complexities of this path, but I still love to challenge myself and improve at what I do.
<br>
Lastly, I've got huge respect for the open-source community, and always love to contribute to them. 

<h4> P.S: (I don't use AI/LLMS for generating any of my code. My usage of them are exclusively for learning purposes only).</h4>

You will find me mostly on Discord: **`.bloodart`**
